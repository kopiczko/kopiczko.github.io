I'm Pawe≈Ç Kopiczko. I'm Scala developer currently focused on extending my knowledge about Hadoop ecosystem.  I'm writing this blog mainly because ["You should blog even if you have no readers"](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html).  Besides I'd like to have place where I can store my thoughts and references to things I found out. Hopefully I will also get value from discussion with other people by exposing myself to criticism.
